We also specify a reference potential that will be added to the learned 2-body and many-body potential components. Here we use a one-body potential i.e. a reference atom energy for each individual species. Usage of a one-body reference potential generally results in very slightly reduced fit accuracy but significantly improved 2-body potentials with a realistic dimer shape and improved robustness in predictions.","category":"page"},{"location":"literate_tutorials/TiAl_model/","page":"The acemodel interface","title":"The acemodel interface","text":"model = acemodel(elements = [:Ti, :Al],\n\t\t\t\t\t  order = 3,\n\t\t\t\t\t  totaldegree = 6,\n\t\t\t\t\t  rcut = 5.5,\n\t\t\t\t\t  Eref = [:Ti => -1586.0195, :Al => -105.5954])\n@show length(model.basis);\nnothing #hide","category":"page"},{"location":"literate_tutorials/TiAl_model/","page":"The acemodel interface","title":"The acemodel interface","text":"The next line specifies the regression weights: in the least squares loss different observations are given different weights,","category":"page"},{"location":"literate_tutorials/TiAl_model/","page":"The acemodel interface","title":"The acemodel interface","text":"  sum_R Big( w^E_R  E(R) - y_R^E ^2\n           + w^F_R  rm forces(R) - y_R^F ^2\n           + w^V_R  rm virial(R) - y_R^V ^2 Big)","category":"page"},{"location":"literate_tutorials/TiAl_model/","page":"The acemodel interface","title":"The acemodel interface","text":"and this is specificed via the following dictionary.
