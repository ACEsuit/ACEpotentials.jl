`ACEpotentials.jl` provides a user-oriented and interface to a collection of several Julia packages that interoperate to fit models for atomic cluster expansion (ACE) interatomic potentials. ACE models are defined in terms of body-ordered polynomial invariant features of atomic environment. For details we refer to the references listed below. 

For a quick start, we recommend reading the installation instructions, followed by the tutorials, in [the documentation.](https://acesuit.github.io/ACEpotentials.jl/dev).

### NOTE!

In the past we provided a JSON and command line interface for constructing ACE models without needing to use Julia scripts. These have are currently not up to date with the latest improvements to ACE model defaults. For the time being we recommend using `ACEpotentials.jl` only through the Julia interfaces.

<!-- - `ACEpotentials.jl` is still under development, so the documentation might not be upto date (use dev version). -->
