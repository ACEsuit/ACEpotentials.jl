`ACEpotentials.jl` facilitates the creation and use of atomic cluster expansion (ACE) interatomic potentials. See [the documentation](https://acesuit.github.io/ACEpotentials.jl/dev) for installation instructions, tutorials, and more.

**NOTE!** An earlier version provided JSON and command line interfaces for constructing ACE models without direct use of Julia scripts. These have become outdated and for the time being we recommend using `ACEpotentials.jl` via the Julia interfaces.
