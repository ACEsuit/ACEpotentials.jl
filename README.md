`ACEpotentials.jl` provides a user-oriented and interface to a collection of several Julia packages that interoperate to fit models for atomic cluster expansion (ACE) interatomic potentials. ACE models are defined in terms of body-ordered polynomial invariant features of atomic environment. For details we refer to the references listed below. 

For a quick start, we recommend reading the installation instructions, followed by the tutorials, in [the documentation.](https://acesuit.github.io/ACEpotentials.jl/dev).

### NOTE!

- The JSON and command line interface have not been updated to include the most recent advances in ACE models available through the Julia interfaces. Until this changes, we recommend using `ACEpotentials.jl` only through the Julia interfaces. 
- `ACEpotentials.jl` is still under development, so the documentation might not be upto date (use dev version).
