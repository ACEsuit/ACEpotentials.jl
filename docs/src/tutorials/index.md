# Tutorials Overview

* [Basic Julia Workflow](../literate_tutorials/basic_julia_workflow.md) : minimal example to fit a potential to an existing dataset using a Julia script
* [Basic Shell Workflow](scripting.md) : basic workflow for fitting via the command line
* [Smoothness Priors](../literate_tutorials/smoothness_priors.md) : brief introduction to smoothness priors
* [Basic Dataset Analysis](../literate_tutorials/dataset_analysis.md) : basic techniques to visualize training datasets and correlate such observations to the choice of geometric priors
* [Descriptors](../literate_tutorials/descriptor.md) : `ACEpotentials` can be used as descriptors of atomic environments or structures, which is described here.
* [Sparse Solvers](../literate_tutorials/asp.md) : basic tutorial on using the `ASP` and `OMP` solvers.
* [ETACE Models](../literate_tutorials/etace_tutorial.md) : using the EquivariantTensors backend for ACE models, including conversion from standard ACE models and creating ETACE models from scratch.
* [ETACE LAMMPS Export](../literate_tutorials/etace_lammps_tutorial.md) : end-to-end workflow for fitting an ETACE model and exporting it for use with LAMMPS molecular dynamics.
