# Tutorials Overview

* [Basic Julia Workflow](../literate_tutorials/basic_julia_workflow.md) : minimal example to fit a potential to an existing dataset using a Julia script 
* [Basic Shell Workflow](scripting.md) : basic workflow for fitting via the command line
* [Smoothness Priors](../literate_tutorials/smoothness_priors.md) : brief introduction to smoothness priors
* [Basic Dataset Analysis](../literate_tutorials/dataset_analysis.md) : basic techniques to visualize training datasets and correlate such observations to the choice of geometric priors
* [Descriptors](../literate_tutorials/descriptor.md) : `ACEpotentials` can be used as descriptors of atomic environments or structures, which is described here.
