# Command Line JSON (TiAl)

In this tutorial we will fit a TiAl potential using the ACE fitting script of ACEpotentials and a JSON file with all the mandatory and non-default parameters. The fitting itself is simply

```bash
julia .../ACEpotentials.jl/scripts/ace_fit.jl --params ace_params.json
```

For this example, the parameters file contains the following. For more details see section on "Command line interface" and "ACEpotentials Internals". 

```json

Brief explanation of the main entries:

* `ACE_fname` - filename for the fitted potential. The script will produce a file called `ACE.json` which can be read by julia and python, and a file called `ACE.yace` which can be read by lammps. 
* `e0` - isolated atom energies
* `weights` - weights for the loss function, for the specific structures. The labels (e.g. "TiAl_T5000") correspond to the "config_type" entry in the .xyz's "info" field. 
* `P` - specifies (a part of) the regularisation (optional).  
* `data` - `.xyz` filename with atomic structures and the specific energy/force/virial entries to fit to. 
* `solver` - specifies the LSQR solver
* `basis 
   - "main_ace" - defines the ACE basis
   - "main_pair" - defines the pair basis
