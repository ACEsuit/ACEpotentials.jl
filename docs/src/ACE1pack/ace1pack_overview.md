# Overview

`ACEpotentials.jl` has two purposes: (1) to import and re-export `ACE1.jl`, `ACEfit.jl`, `JuLIP.jl` with guaranteed version compatibility; and (2) to have several convenience wrappers for setting up the least-squares problem (`ACE1.jl` & `JuLIP.jl`) and solving it (`ACEfit.jl`). 

A short summary of packages behind `ACEpotentials`:

* `ACE1.jl` specifies the parameterisation of interatomic potentials in terms of the (linear) atomic cluster expansion; it provides functions to generate invariant basis sets, and to evaluate the resulting interatomic potentials.
* `ACEfit.jl` supplies the functionality for parameter estimation. Presently, it focuses purely on linear models and linear observations. ACEpotentials provides various tools to deal with the typical data to which interatomic potentials are fitted (total energies, forces, virials, etc) and the reading and transforming of training data. A broad range of solvers are available through this ACEfit. 
* `JuLIP.jl` is a simple molecular simulation code in pure Julia, focusing primarily on an infrastructure to develop interatomic potentials. It provides various generic functions on top of which all our packages on this page build.

## General structure

The main convenience functions are:

* TODO `make_ace_db()` - make the design matrix ("ACE database") for the least-squares problem. 
* TODO `fit_ace_db()` - fit the given ACE database
* `fit_ace()` - `make_ace_db()` and `fit_ace_db()` in one go.

See [Fitting ACE](fit.md) for more information. 

All of these functions take nested dictionaries that specify various parameters in making ACE. For convenience, there are a number of `*params` functions exported by ACEpotentials that return these dictionaries with complete set of parameters specified. These are: 

* `fit_params()` - highest-level parameters' dictionary, compatible with all of `make_ace_db()`, `fit_ace_db()` and `fit_ace()`, see [fit.md];
* `basis_params()` - parameters for constructing various bases for the design matrix of the ACE least squares database, see [Fitting ACE](fit.md);
* `degree_params()` - for specifying the degree of ACE basis, see [Constructing Basis](basis.md);
* `transform_params()` - parameters to specify the transform for a given basis, see [Constructing Basis](basis.md);
* `data_params()` - for reading geometries and to-be-fitted property values, see [Handling Data](data.md); 
* `regularizer_params()` - to set up an extra regularizer, see [Regularizers section in Solers](solver.md);
* `solver_params()` - to set up solver for the least-squares problem, see [Solvers](solver.md). 

In addition, there are some utility functions:  

* `save_fit()` - save given potential to file, see [Fitting ACE](fit.md);
* `fill_defaults()` - recursively fills in default values for any of the optional parameters that were left unspecified, see [Helper Functions](helpers.md);
* `parse_ace_basis_keys()` - for parsing `"(element1, number)" -> ("element1", number)`-type entries that were read in from `.json` or `.yaml` files, see [Helper Functions](helpers.md); 
* `db_params()` - a subset of parameters returned by `fit_params()`, compatible with `make_ace_db()` only, see [Fitting ACE](fit.md); 
* `load_dict()` - reads in parameters from `.yaml` or `.json` format, see [Helper Functions](helpers.md).



TODO
* functions with different calls (fit_ace_db) have docs look correctly?
