# Fitting ACE 

## Top-level overview

The most minimal way of generating an ACE potential is 

```julia
using ACEpotentials
params = ... # see below 
fit_ace()
```

In the first instance, the parameters' dictionary (`params`) is generated by the `*params()` functions described in the rest of these pages. It can also be read from a `.json` or `.yaml` file. 

`fit_ace()` takes the dictionary generated by `fit_params()`

```@docs
fit_ace
fit_params
```

Parameters `LSQ_DB_fname_stem` and `fit_from_LSQ_DB` determine if the least-squares gets saved and/or where/how it gets fit from. 

* `LSQ_DB_fname_stem` is set to `""`: LsqDB is neither saved to nor read from file;
* `LSQ_DB_fname_stem` is given:
    * file not present: LsqDB saved to disk and fit to;
    * file present:
        * `fit_from_LSQ_DB` is true: fit to the LsqDB on disk;
        * `fit_from_LSQ_DB` is false: rename old LsqDB; make, save and fit to a new LsqDB.    


# TODO
### Create LsqDB & fit it separately
#
#It is also possible to decouple making the least-squares database from fitting to it. 
#
#```@docs
#make_ace_db
#fit_ace_db
#```
#
#In fact, `fit_ace()` just calls both of these in one go.

## Reading parameters in from file

Dictionaries may be read in from file with

```julia
params = load_dict("params.json")
# or 
params = load_dict("params.yaml")
```

There is a convenience function `fill_defaults()` that recursively fills in any missing values with defaults, so that only mandatory or non-default values have to be saved in the files.

```@docs
fill_defaults
```

## Examples of minimal set of parameters

### Minimal set

To give an overview of the structure of the parameters' dictionary below is an example with only the mandatory values filled in. 


```julia
mandatory_params = Dict(
    "data" => Dict(
        "fname" => "training_set.xyz"),
    "basis" => Dict(
        "main_ace" => Dict(
            "species" => ["Ti", "Al"],  
            "N" => 2,                   # correlation order
            "maxdeg" => 10,             # polynomial degree
            "type" => "ace"),           # specifies many-body/ace basis functions 
        "main_pair" => Dict(
            "species" => ["Ti", "Al"],  
            "maxdeg" => 4,              # polynomial degree for the 2-body functions
            "type" => "pair"            # specify 2-body basis
            ),),
    "solver" => Dict(
        "type" => "rrqr"),              # use rank-revealing QR factorisation 
    "e0" => Dict(                       # isolated atom energies, eV
        "Ti" => -1586.0195,
        "Al" => -105.5954))
```

### With all default values

The following is the full set of parameters, including the default values.
