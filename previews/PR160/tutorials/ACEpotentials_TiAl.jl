# # TiAl potential (ACEpotentials-julia) 
#
# In this tutorial we repeat what was done in [Fitting a TiAL potential][TiAl.md], but only using ACEpotentials. 

# `ACEpotentials.jl` has two purposes: (1) to import and re-export `ACE1.jl`, `ACEfit.jl`, `JuLIP.jl` with guaranteed version compatibility; and (2) to have several convenience wrappers for setting up the least-squares problem (`ACE1.jl` & `JuLIP.jl`) and solving it (`ACEfit.jl`). For full documentation see [ACEpotentials overview](../ACEpotentials/acepotentials_overview.md).

# First import ACEpotentials

using ACEpotentials

# First, we need to construct various parameters' dictionaries that define various aspects of fitting an ACE potential. We use various `*params()` functions that return these dictionaries and let us only specify mandatory and non-default parameter values. 

# TODO: this is not a very nice artifact approach, but we may drop this tutorial anyway
