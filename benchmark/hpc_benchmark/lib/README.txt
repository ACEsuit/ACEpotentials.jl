JULIAC LIBRARY FILES
====================

Copy your compiled juliac ACE library files here:

1. libace_tial_ace.so    - The compiled ACE model (or your model name)
2. aceplugin.so          - The LAMMPS plugin loader

These files are generated by the juliac export process from ACEpotentials.jl.

If you don't have these files, the benchmark will run ML-PACE only.

Example location from original benchmark:
  deployments/tial_ace/lib/libace_tial_ace.so
  deployments/tial_ace/lammps/plugin/build/aceplugin.so
